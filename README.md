### Terraform Enterprise FDO Deployment on Azure using Podman and disk operational mode

This repository provides an automated way to deploy Terraform Enterprise (TFE) on Azure using:
- FDO (Flexible Deployment Options)
- Podman
- Disk operational mode
- Terraform-based infrastructure automation
- AWS Route53 to manage DNS records and handle SSL certificate validation for the Azure virtual machine.

This project automates the entire process, providing a repeatable, consistent, and reliable way to deploy TFE in minutes using Terraform.

## Prerequistes

This guide was executed on MacOS so it assumes the following:
- You have Git installed.
- Azure Credentials are configured.
- AWS Credentials are configured.
- Terraform is installed (tested with Terraform 1.5.7)

git clone https://github.com/mohamed-hashicorp/azure-tfe-fdo-docker-dm-si.git
```
- Change the directory
```
cd azure-tfe-fdo-docker-dm-si
```

## Configure your variables

  cloud { 
    hostname = "server1.mohamed-abdelbaset.sbx.hashidemos.io" 
    organization = "organization" 
    workspaces { 
      name = "workspace" 
    }

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.
HCP Terraform has been successfully initialized!
You may now begin working with HCP Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to
see any changes that are required for your infrastructure.
If you ever set or change modules or Terraform Settings, run "terraform init"
again to reinitialize your working directory.
